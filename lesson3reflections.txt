Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: I would use remote repository in following situations:
1. when I am using different computers (maybe from different places) to work on the project.
2. when multiple people are working on the project


Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: I would want to pull changes manually because I want to decide when changes are ready to by synchronized.


Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A:
fork: used to get a copy of an online repository, hosted on github to our github account.
clone: used to get a copy of an online/remote repository to our local system.
branch: used to get a copy from master branch, so that we can introduce changes without affecting the master.
