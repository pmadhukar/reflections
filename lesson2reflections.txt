Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A: When I initialize a repository a .git folder is added which contains all the metadata related to my repository.

We need to initialize a repository so that git can control the versions
and we may utilize the power of git.



Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

A: Staging area is the intermediate place where git keeps a file to which will be committed.
It is different from the working directory because we are putting files from working directory to the staging area by command git add
It is different from the repository because files will be committed from staging area to the repostitory.
